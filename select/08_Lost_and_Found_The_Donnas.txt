If this it I want it all of the time
Not good at waiting, not like the others
I looked at you and I missed my cue
Felt like you knew what I was goin' through

Well it took too long for you to find me
And the whole time you were right behind me

'Cause they all said that I lost you
Didn't know how much it cost you
And now everything revolves around you
Yeah, ever since I lost and found you

How could I have missed you with so many chances
So many close calls, so many glimpses
I got a feeling that we've been here before
This time I know what I'm lookin' for

Well it took too long for you to find me
And the whole time you were right behind me

'Cause they all said that I lost you
Didn't know how much it cost you
And now everything revolves around you
Yeah, ever since I lost and found you

Well it took too long for you to find me (for you to find me)
And the whole time you were right behind me (right behind me)

'Cause they all said that I lost you
Didn't know how much it cost you
'Cause they all said that I lost you
Didn't know how much it cost you
And now everything revolves around you
I Lost and found you
'Cause they all said that I lost you
Didn't know how much it cost you
And now everything revolves around you
I lost and found you

I lost and found you
