[00:21.97] He held his breath to hold your hand
[00:27.46] To walk the stair steps in pairs
[00:32.55] Climbing up a slippery slope
[00:38.22] I'm in love, love I hope
[00:50.22] 
[00:44.38] Don't go home, Angelina
[00:53.62] Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found
[01:18.62] 
[01:12.70] He kissed you quick, feeling weird
[01:18.14] Lonely leered and disappeared
[01:23.13] This is such a simple place
[01:28.58] The passing time can't erase
[01:42.58] 
[01:34.80] Don't go home, Angelina
[01:44.50] Paint tomorrow blue
[01:54.00] 
[02:06.51] Day breaks
[02:11.12] But every morning when he wakes, he thinks of you
[02:35.62] 
[02:39.82] I'm alone, that's okay
[02:45.11] I don't mind most of the time
[02:50.09] I don't feel afraid to die
[02:55.96] She was here, passing by
[03:07.96] 
[03:01.96] Don't go home, Angelina
[03:11.15] Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found
[03:19.71] Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found
