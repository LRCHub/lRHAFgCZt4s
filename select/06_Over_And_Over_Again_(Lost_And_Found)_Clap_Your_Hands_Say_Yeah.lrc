[00:28.13] I heard it from a friend
[00:31.39] The revolution never happened
[00:34.59] Sigh, a little die
[00:36.49] No more a child
[00:37.56] Goodbye
[00:41.06] 
[00:41.96] Now where's the woolen sweater
[00:45.53] You mentioned in the letter?
[00:47.94] Imply, the other guy
[00:50.24] And scandalize the lion
[01:01.74] 
[01:09.72] A clean shave in the morning
[01:12.87] And a full beard with no warning
[01:16.28] Time has gotten by on alibis and wine
[01:34.78] 
[01:23.30] Success is so forbidding
[01:26.84] But it makes me think I'm winning
[01:29.70] Quiet, a dim the lights
[01:31.67] Adopt another lifestyle
[01:43.17] 
[01:36.96] Come and come and come on, come and come and come on
[01:40.28] Come and come and come on, come and come and come on
[01:43.47] Come and come and come on, come and come and come on
[01:47.04] Come and come and come on and over again
[02:07.04] 
[02:04.20] You look like David Bowie
[02:07.53] But you've nothing new to show me
[02:10.80] Start another fire
[02:12.62] And watch it slowly die
